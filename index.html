    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      This summer, I began designing and 3D-printing custom toy cars to donate to children in underserved communities. My goal? To make STEM and design accessible, fun, and meaningful—one toy at a time.

    <h2>Our Impact</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>30+</strong> cars 3D printed and donated<br />
      <strong>25+</strong> children reached with hands-on car play and design

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      This project began with a simple idea: combine my love for Formula 1 and design with a way to help kids smile. I learned how to use Tinkercad to 3D model a car, and printed my first prototype using the Brampton Library’s Makerspace. Over time, I scaled the model, refined it, and ensured it was safe and fun for children.
    </p>
    <p>
      I faced real obstacles—each car took nearly 3 hours to print, and the printer was often booked. Still, I managed to create and package 3 working models and reached out to King Academy Child Care Centre to donate them. After confirming by email, I officially delivered the cars, seeing them bring joy to real kids.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also reflected on every aspect of the design: how to make it lightweight and safe, how to reduce plastic waste during printing, and how to cater the form factor to young children. Using techniques like cross-hatching and reinforced wings, I minimized material use and maximized durability. With bright colors, smoothed edges, and functional wheels, each car represents thoughtful engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      From rough sketches and CAD software to printed models in kids' hands, this journey taught me the value of persistence, problem-solving, and purpose-driven design.

    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      “Driven to Give” started as a passion for cars, design, and helping others. With each 3D-printed toy, I’ve learned about CAD, materials, and what it means to give back through engineering. I’m continuing to expand this initiative by developing printable kits and STEM-based learning cards for kids to explore how their cars work.
